# Say What? hackHer Project
My team and I created a web application called 'Say What?' that enables intergenerational communication by converting slang-heavy sentences into more understandable language and displaying sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative). We built it using:

🖥️ Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Motion
⚙️ Backend: FastAPI, Pydantic, Urban Dictionary API, OpenAI API & vaderSentiment
